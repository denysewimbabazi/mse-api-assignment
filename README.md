## Data Source
**PDF Reports**: Download all MSE historical reports from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Bg7MiCViXxpPIB3jfpkClUM1HiLVrAEn?usp=sharing)

**Important**: Download all PDF reports and place them in the `data/raw_pdfs/` folder before starting the assignment.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Download PDF reports from the Google Drive link above
3. Place all PDFs in the `data/raw_pdfs/` folder
4. Create other necessary folders such as `csv_files`
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure database connection

## Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: PDF Data Extraction (25%)
**Objective**: Modify the existing `mse_pdf2csv.py` script to process all MSE reports from 2017 to present. Each report contains daily stock prices in tabular format - your task is to extract these complete daily price tables and convert them to CSV format. Reference the [example CSV files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-XTEDGa982HmXqpk92w5Du3oIHTvCMIq?usp=sharing) from our class exercises to understand the expected output structure and format. 

**Current Status**: The existing script in `src/utils/mse_pdf2csv.py` works for reports up to 2021. Your task is to modify/extend it to handle all reports through the present.

**Challenges to Address**:
- **Varying number of tickers** across different time periods
- **Format changes** in report tables post-2021
- **Inconsistent table structures** between older and newer reports
- **Data quality issues** and missing values. 

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Updated `mse_pdf2csv.py` script that handles all report formats (2017-present)
- [ ] Error handling for problematic PDFs
- [ ] Data validation and cleaning
- [ ] Daily CSV files in a folder withing the data folder with standardized format
- [ ] Recommended: merged csv file for use in next step


### Task 2: Database Management (15%)
**Objective**: Set up and populate a PostgreSQL database with your extracted stock price data. You may build upon the database created during our class exercise. Use the same database schema and ticker information sources as outlined in our class exercise - refer to this [class document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w3N9B7hw41iS5cheyZYfnVUVdqLGiOmn-94eDJ4jRCQ/edit?usp=sharing) for the complete database structure and ticker table specifications.

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Create a database, you can call it `mse_db` or any other name
- [ ] Add two tables, one for `tickers` (as we did in class exercise) and another for `daily prices`
- [ ] Make sure you allow missing values in some columns as necessary 
- [ ] Handle duplicate records and data conflicts
- [ ] Load/import data into the database tables


### Task 3: API Development (20%)
**Objective**: Complete the REST API endpoints. Your API must implement the following 5 endpoints:
#### 1. GET /companies
**Description**: Return all companies listed on the MSE

**Query Parameters**:
- `sector` (optional): Filter by sector

**Example**: `GET /companies?sector=Banking`

**Response**: List of companies with ticker, name, sector, listing date

#### 5. GET /prices/latest
**Description**: Get the most recent trading day prices

**Query Parameters**:
- `ticker` (optional): Stock ticker symbol. If omitted, returns latest prices for all stocks

1. **Step1**: I downloaded the pdf reports and saved them as shown in the above structure
2. **Step2**: Modified the mse_pdf_csv.py so that all the pdf can be extracted. After the extraction, there has been creation of a logs folder to store unprocessed pdfs
3. **Step3**: Creation of notebook(in notebooks folder) to create tables in the database(created in the postgresql using powershell) then load the data extracted after preprocessing them (database_creation.ipynb)
4. **Step4**: Developed an API using python (mse_api.py) and it is saved in the main project folder
5. **Step5**: Created a folder named 'screenshots' in the '/docs' folder. This folder contains the screenshots showing how the API scripts works from the beginning up to the last endpoints. To ensure recency, each screenshot shows the time when it was taken at the bottom right corner.(it shows the computer system time)
6. **Step6**: Developed a python script(mse_api_with_grok.py) to Deploy the API using ngrok for live testing. I also saved related screenshots in the screenshots folder
    
    **_ngrok Links_**: 
    - https://kailey-nonresponsive-squamosely.ngrok-free.dev (main)
    - https://kailey-nonresponsive-squamosely.ngrok-free.dev/docs (docs)

    But the issue is that they can not respond while the ngrok server is shut down.
